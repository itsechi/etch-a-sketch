## Etch-a-Sketch
This is a browser version of the etch-a-sketch toy. You can pick a default black pen, eraser, rainbow mode (which generates a random rgb color on each pixel) and shading mode (which incrementally darkens colors). You can also select the size of your grid (from 5x5 to 100x100) and reset the canvas.  

## What could be improved
* (DONE) make a toggle function that activates the pen only when the user clicks on the grid
* add more functions like export or undo button
